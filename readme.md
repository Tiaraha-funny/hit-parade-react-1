# Hit Parade in React

I will document my amazing project in the future.

## Main refactor
-Create a better file structure (stylled components folder, containers, ...)

## Redux
- Refactor this project to use a **redux store**
- Create the redux store (installing redux...)
- replace the context file by a redux architecture
- Create reducers for **Songs, CartItems** and **styles** and actions
- Check each components, and see what they need (**state, action**)
- **Connect** all those components into the **store**
- You can create **container** for **connecting** your components, or use **hooks**
- Do the **localeStorage** at the end
